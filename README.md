# Loan-Default-Risk-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

## Overview

This repository implements a rigorous machine learning pipeline for predicting loan default risk, exploring diverse algorithms with systematic experimentation on feature engineering, regularization, and model architectures. The framework enables robust comparison of 14 classification approaches under consistent evaluation protocols.
