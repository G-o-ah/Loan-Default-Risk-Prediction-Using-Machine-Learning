# Loan-Default-Risk-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A comprehensive research-driven machine learning project for predicting loan default risk using advanced feature engineering, supervised learning models, and statistical evaluation.

# Overview
This project explores advanced machine learning techniques for predicting loan default risk, with a strong focus on feature engineering, model interpretability, and rigorous evaluation. The work benchmarks classical models (logistic regression, decision trees) against modern approaches (gradient boosting, SVMs, neural networks), using real-world financial data.

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Imputation, outlier handling, domain-driven feature construction.

## Modeling: Logistic regression (with regularization), tree ensembles (Random Forest, XGBoost), SVMs, and multi-layer neural networks.

## Evaluation: Stratified cross-validation, AUC-ROC, F1, Gini, and SHAP-based interpretability.

# Key Results
## Best Model: Gradient Boosted Trees (AUC-ROC ≈ 0.86, Gini ≈ 0.72)

## Top Features: Credit utilization, payment history, inquiry frequency.

# Research Directions
## Model robustness under concept drift

## Explainable AI for credit risk

## Privacy-preserving federated learnin
